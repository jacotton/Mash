This version has been lightly hacked to add a new command (Mash info -a) that dumps
a tab-format table of hashes and counts for each hash. I could see a way to get the hashes in a sketch (-d) or the counts (-c)
but not a way to get which count belongs to which hash. 

Mash is normally distributed as a dependency-free binary for Linux or OSX (see
https://github.com/marbl/Mash/releases). This source distribution is intended
for other operating systems or for development. Mash requires c++14 to build,
which is available in and GCC >= 5 and XCode >= 6.

See http://mash.readthedocs.org for more information.
